## [Eligibility Criteria](https://blog.lido.fi/introducing-early-adoption-for-community-staking-module/)

Eligibility for the Lido (LDO) airdrop was based on the following requirements:

### Early Lido Stakers
- Only early Lido stakers are eligible.
- Users must check their wallet address against the official eligibility list.
- Airdrop amounts are calculated based on a predefined formula in the proposal.
- Users who have already claimed cannot claim again.

### Claiming Process
1. **Check eligibility**
   - Find your address in the [official eligibility list](https://lido.fi) and note your index.
   - If your address is not on the list, you are not eligible.
2. **Verify claim status**
   - Go to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4b3EDb22952Fb4A70140E39FB1adD05A6B49622B).
   - In the "Contract/Read Contract" tab, find the `isClaimed` method.
   - Enter your index and press Query.
   - If the result is `false`, you can proceed. If `true`, your airdrop has already been claimed.
3. **Claim LDO tokens**
   - Open "Contract/Write Contract" on Etherscan.
   - Connect your wallet (MetaMask or WalletConnect).
   - Fill in the claim method fields with:
