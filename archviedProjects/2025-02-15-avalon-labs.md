## [Eligibility Criteria](https://x.com/avalonfinance_/status/1889116096248308097)

Eligibility for the Avalon Labs airdrop was based on the following requirements:

### Minimum Reward
- Every eligible user who interacted with Avalon Labs contracts and completed airdrop registration is guaranteed at least 5 AVL.

### Avalonians (99.5% of total users)
- Immediate 100% unlock at Token Generation Event (TGE).

### AVL Whales (0.5% of users)
- Subject to linear vesting.

### IDO Whitelist Holders
- Fixed reward of 200 AVL.

### Calculation of AVL Airdrop Allocation
- Users with an AVL allocation of less than 5: no adjustments.
- Allocations between 5 and 50,000 AVL: adjusted amount calculated as (50,000 ^ 0.3 * AVL) ^ 0.77.
- Allocations exceeding 50,000 AVL: adjusted amount follows the formula: 50,000 + (AVL â€” 50,000) ^ 0.9.

### Sybil Attack Prevention
- For People Launchpool Users, Marketing Campaigns Participants, and CEX Campaigns Participants:
  - Addresses with batch transfers or cross-address transactions are limited to one counted address.
  - Address must have at least 100 AVL points from other Avalon airdrop categories to be eligible.
