## [Eligibility Criteria](https://gammaswap.com/blog/gammaswap-airdrop)

Eligibility for the GammaSwap ($GS) airdrop was based on the following requirements:

### Points System
- Users must have a non-zero value in lending points, borrow points, or referral points.
- Initial point airdrop given to Alpha Mainnet and Testnet users with multipliers (2x and 1.5x, respectively).
- Perpetual options traders earned 2 points for each $1 notional traded.
- Liquidity Providers (LPs) earned 1 point for each $1 in liquidity provided.
- Points were updated daily at random times.

### Distribution Curve
- A curve was implemented in the distribution to prevent top wallets from receiving a disproportionate share. Initially, the top 5 wallets would have received 25% of the airdrop; after applying the curve, they will receive approximately 10%.

### Additional Airdrop
- An additional 3,200,000 GS tokens (0.2% of the total supply) are allocated for pufETH holders as part of an airdrop, with an average of 22 GS tokens per wallet.
