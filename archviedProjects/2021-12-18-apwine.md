## Additional Information

- Users who claim the airdrop can use their **APW tokens** to vote in the **Winelisting event**, which determines assets to be added to the APWine AMM.
- The governance model follows a **Curve Finance-style locking mechanism**, where the longer a user locks their APW, the more **voting power** they receive.
- Locked APW cannot be unlocked until the chosen lock duration ends, but users can extend their lock or add more APW.
