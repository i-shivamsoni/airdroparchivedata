## Additional Information

- ENA will be used for governance decisions regarding Ethena’s risk management, exchange integrations, and protocol operations.
- The vesting schedule for the top 2000 wallets includes a pro-rata mechanism where users lose a proportional amount of unvested ENA if they reduce their USDe balance.
- The next incentive campaign, "Sats Campaign," will run for 5 months, rewarding users who participate in Ethena with BTC-backed incentives.
- Unclaimed ENA after 30 days will be redistributed to active Ethena participants.
