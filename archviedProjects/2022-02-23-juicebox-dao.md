## Eligibility Criteria

The eligibility for the Juicebox DAO Benefits airdrop is determined by a composite score calculated by ARCx, based on two key factors:

1. **Governance Participation (60% Weight)**

   - **Measurement**: Number of Juicebox Snapshot proposals a wallet has voted in.
   - **Scoring**: The wallet with the highest participation received 600 points, while the lowest received 0. Other wallets were scored linearly between these bounds. For example, a wallet voting in half as many proposals as the top participant would receive approximately 300 points.
   - **Purpose**: To reward active contributors who engage in the DAOâ€™s decision-making process.

2. **Token Holding Behavior (HODL Factor, 40% Weight)**
   - **Measurement**: Number of days (in UTC) a wallet held at least 1 JBX token, whether claimed or unclaimed.
   - **Scoring**: The wallet with the longest holding period received 400 points, while the lowest received 0. Other wallets were scored linearly. For instance, a wallet holding JBX for half the maximum duration would receive approximately 200 points.
   - **Purpose**: To incentivize long-term support and loyalty to the Juicebox ecosystem.

**Juicebox Benefits Score**

- A composite score combining the Governance Factor (60%) and HODL Factor (40%) was calculated by ARCx to determine eligibility and allocation.
- Users were segmented into tiers (high, medium, low) based on this score, with token distribution varying by tier. Higher tiers received more JBX tokens.

**Snapshot Block**

- To prevent Sybil attacks, scores were calculated at a specific Ethereum block. For this airdrop, the snapshot was taken at block 14,263,369.
- Eligibility was based on historical activity up to that point, not actions taken after the announcement.
