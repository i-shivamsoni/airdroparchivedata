## Eligibility Criteria

### **Score Calculation for Airdrop Eligibility**

The score of each address is determined by the sum of:

1. **Trading Score** - Based on the trading fees paid across all versions of Pika Protocol:

| Trading Score | Paid Trading Fee (USDC) | Number of Addresses |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1             | ≥5                      | 8,551               |
| 2             | ≥50                     | 935                 |
| 3             | ≥500                    | 262                 |

2. **LP Score** - Determined by weighted shares staked in the USDC vault:

| LP Score | Weighted Shares | Number of Addresses |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| 1        | ≥100            | 10,524              |
| 2        | ≥1,000          | 1,345               |
| 3        | ≥10,000         | 488                 |

### **Weighted Shares Calculation for LP Score**

The LP score is calculated based on weighted shares in the USDC vault:

- **Formula**:
  ```
  weighted shares = (staked shares amount * average staked time) / 30 days
  ```
- In **Pika v1**, staked shares are multiplied by **3** because one v1 share equals an average of 2.5 USDC.
- In **Pika v2 & v3**, one share is equivalent to approximately **1 USDC**.

Example calculation:
If a user staked **1 share in Pika v1 for 15 days, 1 share in Pika v2 for 60 days, and 1 share in Pika v3 for 90 days**, their **total weighted shares** would be:

```
(1 * 3 * 15 / 30) + (1 * 60 / 30) + (1 * 90 / 30) = 6.5
```

### **Additional Airdrop Considerations**

- **LPs in Pika v2 with losses**:

  - Users with **losses over 20 USDC** qualify for **3.25 esPIKA per $1 lost**.
  - A total of **~1.71 million esPIKA** is allocated for these users.

- **Community Contributors**:

  - **0.3–0.4 million esPIKA** is allocated for contributors.
  - Pika Protocol will **reach out directly** to confirm eligibility.

- **Meme Contest and Education Contest Winners**:
  - If you won a **Pika meme contest or education contest 2 years ago**, you must **contact Pika on Twitter before the end of June** to claim rewards.
