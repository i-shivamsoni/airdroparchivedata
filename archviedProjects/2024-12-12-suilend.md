## Eligibility Criteria

### General Eligibility

- **Active Participation on Suilend**

  - Before launch, users earned points by depositing or borrowing assets (SUI, USDC, USDT, ETH, SOL, DEEP).
  - 20 million points were distributed daily (10M for deposits, 10M for borrowing).
  - After August 17, 2024, points were awarded only for borrowing (10M points daily).
  - The more points accumulated, the higher the potential $SEND token allocation.

- **Post-Launch Airdrop Eligibility (Season 1 & Beyond)**

  - **Season 1:** Airdrop followed the December 10, 2024 snapshot.
  - **Season 2 (ongoing as of March 24, 2025):** Likely still based on lending/borrowing engagement, but exact criteria should be checked via official Suilend channels.

- **Wallet Requirements**

  - A Sui-compatible wallet is required (e.g., **Sui Wallet, Nightly Wallet**).
  - In Season 1, mobile wallets were emphasized for eligibility.

- **Supported Assets**
  - Engagement with multiple assets (SUI, USDC, USDT, ETH, SOL, etc.) was beneficial.
  - Balancing deposits and borrowing maximized rewards.

### Steps to Qualify (Pre-Launch & Season 1)

1. **Visit SuiLend**: Access [suilend.fi](https://suilend.fi) and click "Launch App."
2. **Connect a Wallet**: Link a compatible Sui-based wallet.
3. **Engage in Activities**: Deposit or borrow assets to earn points.
4. **Monitor Points**: Check accumulated points on the platform.
5. **NFT Rewards**: Highly active users earned "SuiLend Capsules" NFTs as additional rewards.

### Additional Season 1 Allocations

- Tokens were airdropped to:
  - **Users who earned points before the snapshot (December 10, 2024).**
  - **Holders of select NFTs (e.g., Rootlets, Kuno).**
  - **Certain memecoin communities (e.g., $FUD holders).**
  - More details available in official Suilend documentation.

## Additional Information

### **SEND Tokenomics**

$SEND has a total supply of **100 million** tokens, distributed as follows:

| Allocation | Percentage |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Community  | **65%**    |
| Investors  | **20%**    |
| Team       | **15%**    |

The tokenomics are designed to prioritize community participation.

### **What are Mdrops?**

Mdrops are a **new token distribution model** for SEND, ensuring a high initial float while controlling sell pressure:

- When users redeem their $SEND allocation, they receive **mSEND**.
- mSEND must be claimed over time to convert into actual SEND tokens.
- Claiming SEND early incurs a **penalty paid in SUI**, reducing volatility and increasing demand for SUI.

#### **Penalty & Maturity Periods**

| Allocation Type       | Maturity Period |
| --------------------- | --------------- |
| Points & Ecosystem    | **3 months**    |
| Team & Investors      | **6 months**    |
| SAVE Holders (Solana) | **12 months**   |

- After maturity (e.g., **3 months for Points & Ecosystem holders**), users can claim their full SEND tokens without any penalty.

### **Airdrop Breakdown (40M SEND distributed via Mdrops)**

| Category                     | Percentage of Total Supply |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Points Holders & Early Users | **20%**                    |
| Ecosystem Communities        | **5%**                     |
| SAVE Holders (Solana)        | **15%**                    |

### **Unlock Schedule**

| Category  | Unlock Period |
| --------- | ------------- |
| Mdrops    | **Day 1**     |
| Investors | **2 years**   |
| Team      | **4 years**   |

This unlock schedule is designed to **promote long-term commitment** while avoiding rapid inflation.

### **Final Notes**

- **Season 2 eligibility details remain unclear**, but continued engagement (e.g., lending/borrowing) is likely required.
- The **mdrop model ensures gradual claimability**, discouraging early dumping and supporting ecosystem stability.
- Users should follow **official Suilend channels** for updates on Season 2.
