## [Eligibility Criteria](https://www.blum.io/post/blum-badges)

### Primary Requirements

- Earned allocation through platform activity: BPs, MPs, referrals, trading, check-ins, quests, meme creation, bot usage, and more
- User level (0–8) set by percentile ranking across all engagement metrics
- Badges earned for top performance in specific categories (see below)

### Additional Airdrop Opportunities

- Badges provide bonus $BLUM on top of main allocation
- Top badge holders in each category receive extra tokens

### Claim Process

- Claim starts on TGE day via the Blum app/website
- 30% of $BLUM is claimable instantly
- Remaining 70% unlocks daily over 180 days
- Users can claim at any time; unclaimed tokens are burned, reducing total supply
- Claiming later allows for more tokens to unlock, but waiting too long risks losing unclaimed tokens to burn

### Special Conditions

- Claiming is flexible, but unclaimed tokens are burned
- Badges are stackable and independent of user level
- All allocations and badges are visible in the Blum app

### Additional Notes

- User level is determined by overall engagement percentile, not just a single metric
- Badges include: Blumie (Gold, Silver, Bronze), Top Ambassador, Dropgame Master, Onchain Hero, True Fan, Meme Creator, Trading Bot Lord, Tribe Warden
- Each badge has specific criteria and bonus allocation
