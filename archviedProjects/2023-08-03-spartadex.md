## Additional Information

- **Lockdrop Phases**: The lockdrop consisted of two phases:

  - **Phase I (July 24–30, 2023)**: Participants could add or migrate liquidity of selected pairs from Sushiswap or Camelot and lock it in SpartaDEX. Early participants received up to a 15% reward boost, decreasing linearly over the phase.
  - **Phase II (July 30–August 3, 2023)**: Participants could lock their SPARTA tokens (earned in Phase I or through airdrop) and USDC.e to create a SPARTA/USDC.e liquidity pool.

- **Vesting Schedule**: 50% of the rewards from Phase I were available at TGE, with the remaining 50% distributed linearly over a 6-month vesting period.

- **Ecosystem Rewards**: Participants in Phase I not only received one-time rewards but also qualified for ongoing ecosystem rewards, where yields depended on the development of their NFT settlement, which could be minted for free.
