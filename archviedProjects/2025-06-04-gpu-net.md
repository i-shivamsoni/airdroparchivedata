- The platform is live and growing, with a strong validator and provider network
- More airdrop events and rewards are planned for future seasons and roadshows

## Launch Clarifications & Expanded Tokenomics

- The $GPU token launch was designed to be 100% fair, with no team, insider, or advisor allocation (0% to team/insiders).
- Initial launch was delayed for last-minute fixes; internal team wallet tests were performed to ensure bridge safety before public launch. No team wallet held $GPU for personal gain; all test transactions are verifiable on-chain.
- Some on-chain snipers detected activity and traded early, causing a brief price spike to ~$3.5 per $GPU (intended launch price was $1.5). This was not planned or controlled by the team.
- Only 7M $GPU were live at launch, with ~50% available publicly. 27.5% of supply is in the Uniswap LP; the rest is held by community wallets, not the team.
- The bridge briefly crashed due to high gas congestion but resumed the next day.
- Early buyers and snipers took profit after the initial spike, causing an 80% price drop. The team did not expect sniping at this scale.
- Tokenomics: 0% to team/advisors; 80% to community (38.75% GAN chain, 38.75% Subnets, 2.5% initial airdrop); 10% to investors; 10% to liquidity (2.5% per year for 4 years). Initial circulating supply is 7M (2.5% of total), with a max supply of 200M over 35+ years.
- Validators and subnet builders earn from the community pool; subnet builders can earn a large share of 48% rewards from the subnet pool for value contribution and onboarding.
- All productive and transactional activity in the network is powered by $GPU, which anchors execution and value exchange across the ecosystem.
- GPUnet is committed to a community-first approach, with over 1,000 unique GPU providers and 100+ active validators.

## Additional Documentation: $GPU Token Launch & Utility

- The $GPU token has a fixed supply of 200 million, engineered for long-term value creation and sustainable, community-driven growth [[docs]](https://docs.gpu.net/usdgpu-token-launch).
- **Token Allocation:**
  - 80% to the community (developers, node operators, subnet creators); no allocation for team, foundation, advisors, or marketing.
  - 10% to early investors to support platform development.
  - 10% to liquidity reserve for trading and DEXs.
- **Deflationary Model:**
  - Block rate is doubled until 50% of total liquidity, then infinitely halved.
  - All gas fees are burned, creating ongoing deflationary pressure.
- **Subnet Ownership & Rewards:**
  - Subnets are isolated, community-hosted environments for specialized workloads.
  - Each new subnet starts with a block rate of 1,440 $GPU per day.
  - Actual rewards are governed by community voting based on subnet visibility, product quality, and traction.
- **Token Utility:**
  - $GPU is used to rent real-world GPUs on the dapp.
  - Staking: Stake $GPU to become a Queen (governance) or Validator (network security), both with rewards and slashing risks.
  - PoW voting: $GPU grants voting power to support Proof-of-Work subnets and earn further rewards.
