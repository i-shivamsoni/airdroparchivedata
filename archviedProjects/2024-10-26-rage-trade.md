## Eligibility Criteria

The criteria for the airdrop are tied to user activity on the Rage Trade platform and its associated integrations, specifically:

- **V1 Users (4% of total supply)**
  Likely refers to early users who interacted with Rage Trade’s Version 1 platform, including:

  - Trading perpetuals
  - Providing liquidity in vaults
  - Staking assets like USDC or SGLP

  While exact criteria (such as minimum trading volume, deposit amounts, or snapshot dates) haven't been explicitly detailed, it’s common for such airdrops to reward users based on historical activity like trading volume, vault deposits, or time of engagement prior to a snapshot.

- **V2 Users (1.25% of total supply)**
  Applies to users of Rage Trade’s Version 2 platform (v2perp), which was under development as of mid-2023. Eligibility likely involves similar activities (trading, staking, or liquidity provision) on the updated protocol.

  - The smaller allocation suggests either a shorter eligibility window or fewer qualifying users compared to V1.

- **HyperliquidX OG Spot Traders (1.25% of total supply)**
  Targets early spot traders on HyperliquidX, a platform Rage Trade has some integration or partnership with.

  - "OG" implies original or early adopters, so eligibility might depend on trading activity on HyperliquidX before a specific cutoff date.

- **Vesting Terms:**
  - 3-month cliff + 3-month linear vesting
  - Option for deflationary unlock:
    - **"Rage Quit"**: Claim 40% upfront, burn remaining 60%
    - **Standard Vesting**: Full vesting over 15-21 months
