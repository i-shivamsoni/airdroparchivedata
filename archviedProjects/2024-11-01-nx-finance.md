## Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for the Season 1 airdrop, participants were required to:

- **Deposit and Leverage Assets**: Users needed to deposit assets such as SOL, vSOL, or JLP tokens into NX Finance’s vaults (e.g., Lending Vault or Leverage Vault) and utilize leveraged strategies. For example, lending $1 worth of assets might have earned users a set number of points per day (e.g., 3 points/day in past seasons)
- **Total Value Locked (TVL) Points**: Points were awarded based on the amount and duration of assets deposited or lent. The more deposited and leveraged, the higher the points, which determined airdrop eligibility or allocation
- **Staking NX Tokens**: Holding and staking NX tokens was a requirement or a booster for airdrop rewards. For instance, staking NX provided a 50% boost to points earned in subsequent airdrop seasons (e.g., Season 2)
- **Referral System**: Users could earn additional points by referring others to the platform. Each participant received a unique referral code upon joining, and referring friends granted bonus points (e.g., 10% of the points earned by referred users in some campaigns)
- **Team Participation**: Joining or creating a team within the "Nadventure" campaign enhanced rewards. Teams pooled efforts, and collective deposits increased individual point totals, impacting airdrop eligibility
- **Active Engagement**: Interacting with NX Finance’s ecosystem, such as using their strategies (e.g., 10x leverage on JLP or farming points for other Solana projects like Jupiter or Kamino), contributed to eligibility. Historical activity was also considered for retroactive airdrops
- **Wallet Connection**: A Solana-compatible wallet (e.g., Phantom or Backpack) needed to be connected to the NX Finance platform to participate, claim points, or receive tokens
  The claim period ended on November 30, 2024, with unclaimed NX tokens burned
