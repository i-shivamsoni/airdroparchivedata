Eligibility for the WEN airdrop was determined based on participation in the Solana ecosystem. Eligible users included:

  - Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) orders
  - Limit Orders (LO)
  - Perpetual (Perps) orders filled during that period.

- **NFT Holders**: Owners of specific NFT collections, including:

  - Ovols NFTs.
  - Blue-chip Solana NFTs such as Solana Monkey Business, Degenerate Ape Academy, SolPunks, and Solarians.
  - Genesis Saga Holders (likely Solana Saga smartphone owners or a related NFT collection).

- **Equal Distribution**: All eligible wallets received exactly **643,652 WEN tokens**, ensuring fairness across participants. No special allocations were made for influencers, whales, or insiders.
