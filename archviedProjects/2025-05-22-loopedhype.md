## [Eligibility Criteria](https://loopedhype.com/airdrop-registration)

Eligibility for the LoopedHYPE airdrop was based on the following requirements:

### Phase-1 Requirements
- Snapshot taken on March 8, 2025
- Eligible users: LHYPE holders and participants in liquid looping strategies before the snapshot
- stLOOP (staked LOOP) amount determines Looping Mode and points multiplier
- Users can stake LOOP at any time before each phase's closing to earn a multiplier for the following drop
- Missed Phase-1? Buy and stake LOOP before Phase-2 closes to earn the next multiplier
- LP positions in stLOOP/LOOP and LOOP/LHYPE pools also earn points
- Late claim possible for missed registration (allocation at a later date if eligible)

- Loyalty Fund seeded with 15% of total supply; at least 40% goes to loyal holders
- Official token contract: 0x00fDBc53719604D924226215bc871D55e40a1009
- $LOOP is tradeable at launch on multiple DEXs and spot markets
- Community sale reference price: $0.015 per token ($15M FDV)
- Points system: Daily snapshots of LHYPE and stLOOP balances determine airdrop allocation
- Supplying stLOOP to pools still counts toward multipliers
