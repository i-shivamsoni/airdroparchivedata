For example, an early announcement indicated that owning any of these NFTs qualified users for the MEME token airdrop, with 25% of the total supply (17.25 billion tokens) allocated to such holders.

- **Community Participation**: Active engagement in the Memeland community has been emphasized. This includes participating in presale events, staking MEME tokens, or completing tasks on platforms like Telegram via the Memeland Airdrop Bot. For instance, presale participants were often included in airdrop eligibility and sometimes entered into additional reward drawings (e.g., a $1 million MEME prize pool).
