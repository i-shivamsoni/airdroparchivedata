## Eligibility Criteria

- **Account Registration and KYC Verification**: Sign up on the official Supra website ([supra.com](https://supra.com)) or the designated airdrop page. Completing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification is typically required to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and confirm eligibility.

- **Wallet Requirements**: A compatible cryptocurrency wallet is necessary, such as the StarKey wallet recommended by Supra for claiming tokens. Connecting your wallet to the Supra platform may be required to facilitate token distribution. Ensure the wallet is active and not newly created, as some airdrops exclude brand-new wallets to prevent abuse.

- **Community Engagement and Tasks**: Participation in community activities is often a key criterion. This can include completing specific tasks like joining Supraâ€™s social media channels (e.g., Twitter, Telegram, or Discord), sharing content, or referring friends. Tasks might reward you with "Stars" or points, which can later be redeemed for SUPRA tokens. The more tasks you complete, the higher your potential rewards.

- **Token Holding Requirements (if applicable)**: Some phases of the Supra airdrop may require holding a minimum amount of specific tokens, such as GateTokens (GT). For instance, holding at least 10 GT and maintaining an average of 10 GT throughout the campaign has been mentioned in certain contexts. However, this may not apply to all participants or phases.

- **Geographic Eligibility**: Participation is generally open globally, but regulatory restrictions may exclude residents of certain countries (e.g., the USA or China in some cases). It's advisable to check the official airdrop page for an updated list of excluded regions.

- **Gas Fee Preparation**: To claim tokens, a small amount of SUPRA may be needed in your wallet to cover gas fees. This can be obtained from exchanges like KuCoin, Bybit, or Gate.io and sent to your StarKey wallet.

- **Timing and Activity Level**: The airdrop often rewards early or active participants. For instance, the first 500,000 users to join might receive a larger allocation (e.g., 350 SUPRA tokens via community goals). Completing weekly missions or expeditions (e.g., educational quizzes or trading games) can also increase your rewards.

## Additional Information

- **Vesting Schedule**: Token distribution typically follows a vesting schedule: 10% of your allocation may be claimable immediately after the Token Generation Event (TGE), with the rest unlocking gradually over 15 or 30 months, depending on the plan selected.

- **Community Milestone**: The Supra community has surpassed 500,000 participants, indicating strong engagement and interest in the project.

- **Mainnet Launch**: The mainnet launch and TGE occurred around November 27, 2024, marking a significant milestone for the project.
