### Primary Requirements

- Apps (Gems) and users (Points) both eligible for airdrop
- Snapshot taken on June 18, 2025

### Additional Airdrop Opportunities

- Users (Points) receive 25% liquid, 75% vested over 270 days as a tradable NFT (fNFT)
- fNFT can be traded on Paintswap secondary market

### Claim Process

- Claim starts after TGE via official frontend (to be announced)
- Users: 25% claimable immediately, 75% linearly vested over 270 days as fNFT
- Users can claim vested portion at any time; unclaimed portion is burned according to burn formula
- Users have 6 months to claim fNFT; after that, unclaimed tokens are burned
- Apps: 50% claimable immediately, 50% vested over 90 days
- Apps have 3 months to claim tokenized Gems; after that, unclaimed tokens are burned

### Special Conditions

- Linear vesting starts on day 1 of airdrop, not dependent on claim time
- Burn penalty applies to unvested portion if claimed early
- Unclaimed tokens after claim window are burned
- No burn is calculated until after the full vesting/claim period concludes

### Additional Notes

## Additional Information

- Sonic is a high-performance EVM L1 with 400,000 TPS and sub-second finality
- Fee Monetization (FeeM) rewards developers with up to 90% of app-generated fees
- Season 1 airdrop is split between users (Points) and apps (Gems), with different vesting and claim mechanics
- The airdrop uses a linear vesting and burn penalty system, with formulas for upfront, unlocked, burned, and realized tokens
- fNFTs allow users to trade their vested allocations on a secondary market
- All official claim links will be announced via Sonic Labs Twitter

### Vesting & Burn Formulas

1. **Upfront portion:**  
   \( \text{Upfront} = T \times U \)
2. **Unlocked vested portion at claim day C:**  
   \( \text{Unlocked} = (T \times (1-U)) \times \frac{C}{D} \)
3. **Burned portion:**  
   \( \text{Burned} = (T \times (1-U)) - \text{Unlocked} \)
4. **Total Realized (Claimed):**  
   \( \text{Realized} = \text{Upfront} + \text{Unlocked} \)

Where:
- \( T \) = total tokens earned
- \( U \) = upfront % (0.25 for users, 0.5 for apps)
- \( D \) = total vesting days (270 for users, 90 for apps)
- \( C \) = day of claim
