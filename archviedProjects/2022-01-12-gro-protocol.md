## Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for the airdrop, users must meet the following conditions:

- **Provide liquidity to Gro Protocol**: Users need to have a positive balance in the protocol by the snapshot end date. TVL (total value locked) in Vault and PWRD is considered, with higher TVL and longer holding periods increasing allocation weight.
- **Participate in the LBP (Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool)**: Users who acquire and hold GRO from the LBP will receive a higher airdrop allocation. The formula favors those with both protocol liquidity and LBP participation.
- **Same Wallet Requirement**: The same wallet must be used for liquidity provision and LBP participation.
- **Vesting Terms**: 10% of the airdrop is available on day 1, with full vesting after 1 year.
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Citizens and residents of the **United States, Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Crimea (Ukraine), Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Guyana, Iraq, Sudan, and Yemen** are prohibited from participating.
