## Additional Information

- Round 1 airdrop is not the end; holders can potentially double dip if they do not unstake their Round 1 Moca ID Airdrop for Round 2 airdrop.
- Given the success of Cosmic Hunt, the Cosmic Series platform is extended, allowing participants to earn more RP by participating or even spending their RP to earn more RP.
- More RP missions will be rolled out with key Moca Network partners after TGE and before Round 2 airdrop for Moca ID holders to earn more RP.
- Round 2 airdrop aims to reach a wider audience with the reputation being rolled out shortly.
- Staking will commence on Day 0 at TGE for $MOCA holders to earn Staking Power. A booster to Staking Power will apply if holders stake in the first 14 days. Unstaking within the 14-day period will lead to losing all the Staking Power Boost altogether.
