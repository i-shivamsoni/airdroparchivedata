## Eligibility Criteria

### Initial Notcoin Airdrop (May 2024)

- **Participation in the Telegram Game**: Users who participated in the tap-to-earn Telegram game before the mining phase ended on April 1, 2024, were eligible. In-game Notcoins were converted to NOT tokens at a 1,000:1 ratio.

- **Wallet Connection**: Players needed to connect a TON-compatible wallet (e.g., Binance, OKX, Bybit, or Telegramâ€™s Wallet app) to claim their tokens.

- **Claiming Deadline**: Tokens had to be claimed by June 16, 2024. Unclaimed tokens were reallocated for future development or burned.

### Subsequent Airdrops (e.g., July 2024 Campaign)

- **Staking and Level Holders**: $5 million of the July 2024 airdrop was allocated to users who staked their NOT tokens and achieved specific levels (e.g., Gold or Platinum). Staking involved locking tokens for a period (e.g., 30 days) to earn higher status levels, granting access to increased rewards.

- **Community Participation**: $2 million was allocated for users participating in activities over the following three months (July to October 2024), including engaging in campaigns and completing missions.

- **Influence-Based Model**: Notcoin emphasized rewarding users who created value for the community, such as referring quality participants and engaging in social campaigns.
