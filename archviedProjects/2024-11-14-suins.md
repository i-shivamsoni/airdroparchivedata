## Additional Information

SuiNS is a decentralized name service protocol on the Sui blockchain, enabling users to register human-readable names for Sui addresses. The NS token empowers community-driven governance, with all major protocol changes and treasury disbursements subject to on-chain voting. The protocol leverages Sui's object-oriented model for contract upgrades and decentralization, ensuring no key or multisig holders control the protocol. NS tokens can be staked to increase voting power and used for discounted name purchases. The initial airdrop is distributed via soul-bound NFTs, with future rewards for active governance participation.
