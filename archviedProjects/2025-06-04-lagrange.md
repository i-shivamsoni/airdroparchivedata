## Additional Information

- Lagrange powers proof generation for ZK rollups, verifiable AI, and modular execution layers
- $LA is used for proof generation fees, staking, and subsidizing prover costs
- Clients pay for proofs in ETH, USDC, or $LA; provers are always paid in $LA, with buybacks supporting token value
- 4% annual emissions subsidize proving costs and are distributed to provers based on work
- Staking and delegation allow token holders to direct emissions and support specific provers
- $LA holders do not accrue fees or emissions passively; staking is required for participation
- The network is designed for scalability, economic stability, and long-term value accrual
