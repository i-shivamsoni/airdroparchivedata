- Exchange wallets are excluded.
- Eligibility is determined based on a point system:
  - Past, on-chain interaction with AMPL = 1 point (max)
  - Geyser program participation (per day) = 1 point
  - Negative rebase hold (per day) = 1 point
- Geyser and Rebase points are uncapped, meaning long-term supporters accrued more points and thus more FORTH tokens.
