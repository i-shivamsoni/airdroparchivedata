## Airdrop Principles

The $ZEX airdrop is designed to reward genuine users of the protocol, with additional incentives for those who demonstrate a long-term commitment.

- **Z-Score Mechanism**: Trading activity is measured via Z-Score, which forms the foundation of base incentives.
- **Fair Adjustments**: OG and Season 1 Boosts, minimum/maximum criteria, and platform activity requirements ensure sybil resistance and prevent professional farmers from gaining disproportionate rewards.

## Airdrop Bonuses

Two additional mechanisms are in place to reward long-term commitment to the Zeta Protocol:

1. **7-Day Bonus**:

   - Unlocks a portion of the user's allocation linearly over seven days.
   - Encourages patience and long-term participation.

2. **Staking Airdrop**:
   - Rewards $ZEX stakers for their commitment to protocol governance.

## Trading Rewards

- The snapshot for the initial airdrop of $ZEX was taken on **June 7, 2024, at 00:00 UTC**.
- All Z-Score earned since the snapshot contributes to **Epoch 1** of the **Trading Rewards Program**.
- **8 million $ZEX** in rewards are available for traders participating in this program.
