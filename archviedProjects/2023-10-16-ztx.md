## Eligibility Criteria

The ZTX team has not explicitly detailed the exact activities required for the Genesis Airdrop but has provided key hints on how users could increase their chances of receiving $ZTX tokens.
- **Playtest Participation**: Engaging in ZTX public playtests, particularly **Playtest #2**, was directly mentioned as contributing to airdrop eligibility. For example, the playtest running until **July 31, 2023**, was referenced as a way to improve airdrop potential.
- **Ecosystem Engagement**: Activities within the **ZTX metaverse**, such as **completing in-game tasks** or **holding specific assets** (e.g., **Genesis Homes**), were implied to factor into eligibility. Social media posts suggested that Genesis Home holders were included in this airdrop.
- **Community Involvement**: Although not explicitly required, **active participation on Discord, Twitter Spaces, and other ZTX channels** was encouraged as a way to boost chances of receiving the airdrop.

## Additional Information

- **Token Utility**: $ZTX serves multiple purposes within the ZTX ecosystem, including governance (enabling distributed decision-making at the World level), purchasing (acquiring in-game assets like wearables or home decorations), and gameplay enhancements (accelerating progress by speeding up or skipping certain gameplay requirements).

- **Token Buyback Program**: ZTX plans to implement a token buyback program funded entirely by platform revenue. This program aims to repurchase $ZTX on the open market to either burn tokens (reducing total supply), allocate tokens to player rewards, or fund the treasury.

- **Total Token Supply**: The total supply of $ZTX is fixed at 10,000,000,000 tokens.
