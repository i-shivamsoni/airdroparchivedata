Staking typically involves locking up tokens to support network security and operations, and airdrops often reward such participants to encourage long-term commitment.
- **Testnet Contributors**: Users who have actively participated in the Dymension testnet—potentially including testing Sirath Network functionalities as a RollApp—are also eligible. This could involve tasks like running nodes, submitting transactions, or engaging with testnet features, though exact tasks aren't specified.
