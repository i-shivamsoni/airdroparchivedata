## Eligibility Criteria

Users must hold at least one of the following NFTs to be eligible for the initial sign-up reward:

- Guru Season Passes
- Themed Guru NFTs (e.g., Spooky Guru)
- Guru Network DAO NFTs

The reward amount is influenced by several factors:

- **Type of NFT Possessed**: Each type of NFT provides a multiplier that increases the reward amount. For example, Season Passes 1 and 2 have a multiplier of 2, while Themed collections and Guru DAO NFTs have a multiplier of 1. If users hold more than one type of NFT, the multipliers are combined.
- **Governance Participation**: Users who participated in Guru Network Snapshot voting receive an additional reward of 200 GURU tokens.
- **Accumulated Testnet Points**: Points accumulated during the testnet phase (e.g., Burns in Burning Meme, tGuru in Guru Network app) are converted into GURU tokens based on a conversion rate determined by the total value locked (TVL) ratio between mainnet and testnet.
- **App-Specific Rewards**: Applications within the ecosystem may provide additional rewards based on app-specific criteria.

The initial sign-up reward is calculated using the following formula:

`Sign Up Reward = Base Sign Up Reward * Pass Multiplier + Governance Participation Reward + Accumulated Testnet Points * Conversion Rate + App-Specific Rewards`

Where:

- **Base Sign Up Reward**: A fixed amount of 250 GURU tokens.
- **Pass Multiplier**: Determined by the type of NFT(s) held.
- **Governance Participation Reward**: An additional 200 GURU tokens for users who participated in governance activities.
- **Accumulated Testnet Points**: Converted based on a predefined conversion rate.
- **App-Specific Rewards**: Additional rewards provided by specific applications within the ecosystem.

## Additional Information

- **Mainnet Participation**: Users can switch networks directly within the Guru Network app and other ecosystem apps to participate in mainnet activities. This feature is under development, with updates on its availability to be announced.
- **Reward Usage**: Rewards are allocated to app-specific operational wallets and can be used within the apps. Transfers out of these wallets are subject to a cooldown period to prevent misuse and ensure ecosystem integrity.
- **Ecosystem Chest**: An on-chain treasury that distributes rewards to users based on their contributions and activities within the Guru ecosystem.
