## Eligibility Criteria

The airdrop was allocated to **SNX stakers**, with 2% of the total THALES supply (2,000,000 tokens) distributed to the following groups:

- Users who staked SNX for at least one snapshot and claimed rewards at least once.
- Includes:
  - L1 SNX stakers
  - L2 SNX stakers
  - xSNX stakers
  - Yearn vault SNX stakers
- Addresses that made a trade or minted in any market on Thales before the snapshot.
- Holders of any Thales POAP before the airdrop date.
- The airdrop was **not additive**, meaning that if an address qualified in multiple categories, it only received one allocation.

The airdrop used a **Merkle Tree-based contract** ([GitHub link](https://github.com/thales-markets/contracts/blob/main/contracts/Airdrop/Airdrop.sol)) and was claimable via the **Thales dApp**.
