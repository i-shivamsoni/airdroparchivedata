- The protocol will run quarterly seasons for at least two years, with new campaigns being introduced periodically.
- Future milestones will be determined by DAO votes, including rewards campaigns for Season 2 and beyond, funding for Superfluid Protocol V2 development, and potential protocol fee implementations.
