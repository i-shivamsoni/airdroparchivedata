## [Eligibility Criteria](https://medium.com/%40Carv/carv-s1-airdrop-frequently-asked-question-a10a73757706)

Eligibility for the Carv.io (CARV) airdrop was based on the following requirements:

### Minting a CARV ID
- Create a CARV ID (self-sovereign digital identity) by connecting a Web3 wallet and minting on supported chains (opBNB, Ronin, zkSync, or Linea).
- Pay a small gas fee (e.g., ~0.02 BNB on opBNB).

### Active Participation in the Ecosystem
- Engage in CARV's gaming platform (Infinite Play Participation).
- .Play Name Service: Shorter .play names and active users receive higher rewards.
- Link Steam, Twitter, Discord, and wallets to increase $SOUL mining rate and airdrop eligibility.
- Log in daily to mine $SOUL tokens via the CARV platform.

### Snapshot Eligibility
- Snapshot for Season 1 was taken on October 1, 2024 (00:00 AM UTC).
- Eligibility based on participation in the Loyalty Program, Infinite Play, and holding specific assets (e.g., .Play Name Service NFTs, CARV Nodes).

### Holding Specific Assets
- Owning CARV or partnered nodes (e.g., Aethir nodes) qualifies users for the airdrop.
- Holders of Play Name Service, Dragon Treasure NFTs, or other CARV ecosystem NFTs may be eligible.
- veCARV holders from the Loyalty Program or key contributors (KOLs, partners) with vested CARV (veCARV) were included in Season 1.

### Referral and Social Tasks
- Inviting friends to mint a CARV ID and mine $SOUL grants a commission (e.g., 10% of their daily mining rewards).
- Completing actions like following CARV on X, joining Discord, or surveys can qualify users for extra rewards.

### Anti-Sybil Measures
- CARV uses Sybil detection (via Passport XYZ, Nansen, and Gitcoin Passport) to filter out fake accounts.
- Users flagged as Sybil may need to appeal via Discord or meet revised criteria to reclaim rewards.

### Season-Specific Allocations
- Season 1 distributed 40 million CARV (10% of total supply) across three airdrop seasons.
- Future seasons may prioritize ongoing activity, holding/staking CARV, and .Play name length-based rewards.
