## [Eligibility Criteria](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz)

Eligibility for the PURR airdrop was based on the following requirements:

### Points Holders
- 50% of the total PURR supply (1 billion tokens) was allocated to users who had earned points on Hyperliquid.
- Points were accrued primarily through trading perpetual contracts during Season 1 and expanded in Season 2 to include spot trading and asset holding.
- Distribution was proportional to the number of points each user heldâ€”more active traders received a larger share of the 500 million PURR tokens.

### Acceptance of Updated Terms
- To qualify, users had to accept Hyperliquid's updated Terms of Use at [app.hyperliquid.xyz](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz) by April 13, 2024, end of day UTC.
- Users who failed to accept the terms were ineligible, even if they had enough points.

### No Manual Claim Required
- If a user met the eligibility criteria (points held + terms accepted), the PURR tokens were automatically deposited into their Hyperliquid spot account.
- Users could verify their balance directly on the platform.
