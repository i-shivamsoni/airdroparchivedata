## Eligibility Criteria

Eligibility for the GYFI airdrop was determined by the Gyroscope DAO through a series of Gyroscope Improvement Proposals (GIPs):

- **SPIN holders**: As established in GIP-1, SPIN holders can convert their SPIN to GYFI at a rate of 1,066 SPIN per GYFI.
- **Founding Member NFT holders**: According to GIP-2, Founding Member NFT holders are eligible to claim GYFI, with the amount dependent on the rarity of their NFT.
- **Galxe participants**: GIP-2 also established that participants in a Gyroscope Galxe campaign are eligible to claim GYFI.

In total, approximately 12,000 addresses are eligible for GYFI. Additional categories may be added in the future, with considerations for sybil risks.

## Additional Information

- **Lockup Options**: Eligible recipients have three options for claiming GYFI:

  1. **Option 1**: Fully-liquid GYFI tokens, convertible at a rate of 1,066 SPIN per GYFI.
  2. **Option 2**: Lock up GYFI for 9 months and receive 40% more GYFI than Option 1. The locked tokens will start to unlock immediately over the course of 9 months linearly.
  3. **Option 3**: Lock up GYFI for 18 months and get 150% more GYFI than Option 1. There will be a 9-month cliff, so that users receive no liquid tokens before month 9, and then tokens linearly unlock from month 10 onwards.

- **Vesting for Large Allocations**: Allocations above 10,000 GYFI are subject to an additional 6-month linear vesting for the portion above 10,000 GYFI.

- **Supply Details**: The total GYFI supply is 13,700,000 tokens, with a planned annual increase of 2% starting from March 4, 2029.

- **Token Allocation**: 65% of the GYFI token supply is allocated to the community, and 35% to FTL Labs, the initial Gyroscope development company.
