## [Eligibility Criteria](https://mirror.xyz/talentprotocol.eth/nmvM9HDRHuBox9nZh0RBREc-qA6BL1T6WWEdCrHTynQ)

The $TALENT Summer Airdrop rewards early adopters and active members of the Talent Protocol ecosystem. Eligibility is determined by three main categories:

- **Talent Protocol OG Members** (5 different criteria)
- **Ecosystem Members** (12 different criteria)
- **$TALENT Community Round Participants**

Each category is independent, meaning an address can qualify under multiple categories and receive a combined allocation accordingly.

Additionally:

- No vesting or lock-up periods apply to airdropped tokens.
- Community Round participants can increase their allocation by purchasing $TALENT tokens.

### Builderdrop

- **Join the Community Round**: Purchase a ticket to access Builderdrop and receive an initial $TALENT allocation.
- **Boost Your Builder Score**: Earn more tokens by increasing your Builder Score before the snapshot.
- **Receive a Builder Bonus**: Talent Protocol matches your ticket size with a **Builder Bonus** (up to **3x**, based on your Builder Score).
- **Snapshot & Distribution**: When the **Builderdrop prize pool reaches 30M $TALENT**, a final snapshot determines token distribution.

### Eligibility Breakdown:

1. **Create a Talent Passport**: Connect a non-custodial wallet and verify credentials (GitHub, LinkedIn, Coinbase).
2. **Set a Main Wallet**: Required for specific campaigns (e.g., October 2024 airdrop).
3. **Boost Builder Score**: Engage in platform activities to increase your score.
4. **Complete Quests & Tasks**: Earn XP through quests like using ecosystem apps (e.g., builder.fi).
5. **Early Adopter Status**: Rewards prioritize early users and active contributors.
6. **Jurisdiction Restrictions**: Users from certain regions (e.g., **USA, Canada**) may be excluded.
