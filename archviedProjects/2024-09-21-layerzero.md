## [Eligibility Criteria](https://www.layerzero.foundation/eligibility)

Eligibility for the ZRO airdrop was determined through several phases:

- **Sybil Filtering:** Users who self-reported Sybil activity received 15% of their intended allocation. Others were disqualified.
- **Protocol RFP (3% of ZRO Supply):** Wallets listed in an approved Protocol RFP submission received between 5 and 10,000 ZRO.
  - Eligibility factors:
    - Number of messages sent before/after the snapshot
    - Time since first interaction with LayerZero
    - Application type (OApp, OFT, ONFT)
- **Core Distribution (5.5% of ZRO Supply):** Rewarded users based on protocol fees paid before the snapshot.
  - Minimum 25 ZRO, maximum 5,000 ZRO.
  - Transactions under $1 and valueless NFTs were deweighted by 80%.
  - Multipliers for early and post-snapshot users.

**Reallocation Rules (Post-TGE Adjustment):**

- **Eligible:** Users who claimed ZRO and interacted with LayerZero after the Token Generation Event (TGE).
- **Ineligible:** Users who claimed but had no transactions after TGE, and Sybil-flagged wallets.
- Eligible wallets received a **pro-rata share** of unclaimed tokens based on gas fees spent post-TGE.
