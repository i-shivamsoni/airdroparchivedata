## Eligibility Criteria

Users can earn Eigenpie Points through the following methods:

- **Deposit Rewards**: Users receive 1 point every hour for holding a quantity of Liquid Staked Tokens (LSTs) equal in value to 1 ETH.
- **Referral Rewards**: By referring others, users can earn additional points proportional to the points accumulated by their referees. For each point a referee accumulates, the referrer will earn 0.1 points at the end of each hour. For example, if a user refers 10 individuals who together earn a total of 100 points daily, the referrer will consequently earn 10 points each day.
- **Group Boosts**: Users and their referrals form a group that can increase the rate of point accumulation by achieving certain milestones:
  - 1.2x boost when the group's total deposit surpasses 100 ETH.
  - 1.4x boost when the group's total deposit surpasses 500 ETH.
  - 1.6x boost when the group's total deposit surpasses 1,000 ETH.
  - 1.8x boost when the group's total deposit surpasses 2,000 ETH.
  - 2x boost when the group's total deposit surpasses 5,000 ETH.

**Note**: ZkLink users' points are currently unavailable and are expected to be distributed soon.

## Additional Information

- **Airdrop Allocation**: The team has allocated 10% of the EGP token supply solely for the purpose of the airdrop. By depositing LSTs and referring friends, participants have the opportunity to earn free points.

- **Seasonal Distribution**: The airdrop is distributed over two seasons:

  - **Season 1 Airdrop (40%)**: Vested.
  - **Season 2 Airdrop (60%)**: Vested.
  - **Estimated Season 2 Airdrop (40%)**: Unvested.

- **Discrepancy Reporting**: Users are advised to report any potential discrepancies in the calculation via a Discord ticket for review.

- **Note**: Unstaking from ETH restake won't be opened at the same time when LST is unstakable from Eigenpie. It might take up to 10+ days for ETH staking validator being active. Before that, Eigen Layer points won't be accumulated.
