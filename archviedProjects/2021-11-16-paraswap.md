- Exclusion of addresses identified as airdrop hunters using multiple accounts
- Users were assigned **points** based on transaction count, swap amounts, and network usage:
  - **10+ transactions** → +1 point
  - **Single transaction USD value** (>$100 → +1 pt, >$1K → +2 pts, >$10K → +3 pts, >$100K → +4 pts)
  - **Total volume swapped** (>$100 → +1 pt, >$1K → +2 pts, >$10K → +3 pts, >$100K → +4 pts)
  - **Usage across multiple networks** → +1 pt
- Rewards distribution based on points:
  - **>7 points** → 10,400 PSP
  - **4-7 points** → 7,800 PSP
  - **≤3 points** → 5,200 PSP

- Users from **integrations** like Argent and CowSwap were included via special filtering methods.
- Wallets identified as hunter accounts (large blobs of linked addresses, low balance, minimal historical use) were excluded.
