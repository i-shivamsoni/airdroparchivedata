## Eligibility Criteria

The Tevaera airdrop rewards active community members based on **Reputation (Rep) Score**, **Karma Points**, and **specific holding-based criteria** for **Phoenix NFT holders** and **TeviTreat players**.

### **Primary Criteria**

- **Rep Score (Ratio: 3:1 TEVA)**

  - Every **3 Rep Score points = 1 TEVA token**
  - Calculation:
    - 12% of gaming skill points
    - 8% of “game vault” Karma tokens
    - 1% of gaming experience points
    - +1% bonus for holding a **Sphinx NFT**
    - +0.5% for each **Guardian ONFT** on zkSync
    - +2% per **Phoenix NFT**

- **Karma Tokens (Ratio: 1:1 TEVA)**

  - 1 Karma token = 1 TEVA token
  - Earned through:
    - Daily quests and achievements in **Teva Run** or **Teva Quest (Ninja)**
    - Pool play and other engagement activities

- **Phoenix NFT Holders** _(Holding-based eligibility)_

  - Phoenix NFTs **already boost Rep Score** but also qualify for direct rewards:
    - **1 Phoenix** = 5,000 TEVA
    - **2-5 Phoenix** = 15,000 TEVA
    - **6+ Phoenix** = 25,000 TEVA
  - **Snapshot Time**: Eligibility determined at the time of proposal publication.
  - **Rationale**: Recognizing long-term commitment to Tevaera.

- **TeviTreat Players** _(Leaderboard-based eligibility)_
  - The **top 20% of leaderboard players** receive rewards based on their **TeviTickets**.
  - **Ratio**: **Every 50 TeviTickets = 1 TEVA token**.
  - **Eligibility Requirements**:
    - **Link Telegram account**
    - **Mint Gamer ID before November 29, 2024, at 14:00 UTC**
  - **Rationale**: Encourages ongoing engagement and account authentication.

### **Additional Boosters (Extra Rewards Beyond Core Criteria)**

- **Karma Accessory Purchases (1:3)**

  - 1 Karma spent = 3 TEVA tokens

- **Teva Market Transactions (3+ Transactions = 2,500 TEVA)**

  - Buying, selling, listing, or bridging assets earns a bonus

- **Pool Play (50+ Matches = 2,500 TEVA)**

  - Recognizes high engagement in competitive gaming modes

- **ZK Delegation (2,500 TEVA)**

  - Users who staked **100+ ZK tokens** with Tevaera qualify

- **Teva Stars (7,500 - 20,000 TEVA)**

  - Tier-based allocation:
    - **Super Active Stars**: 20,000 TEVA
    - **Active Stars**: 15,000 TEVA
    - **Moderately Active Stars**: 7,500 TEVA

- **Loyal Tevans (10,000 TEVA)**

  - **Teva Quest players with 5,000+ Rep** at the snapshot

- **Moderators (30,000 / 20,000 TEVA)**
  - Select active moderators receive special allocations

### **Sybil Filtering**

Tevaera implements **sybil filtering** to prevent exploitative farming. Identified sybil accounts are excluded based on:

1. **Game data analysis**
2. **Name similarity detection**
3. **On-chain tracking**
4. **Karma purchase patterns**
5. **Pool play reputation farming**

Users could appeal false sybil detection, but invalid appeals resulted in a **total loss of rewards** across all associated wallets.
