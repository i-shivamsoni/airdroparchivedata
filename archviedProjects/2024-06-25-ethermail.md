## [Eligibility Criteria](https://medium.com/@ethermail_io/launching-emt-the-worlds-first-email-token-e2378336de18)

- **Create an EtherMail Account:** Sign up on [EtherMail.io](https://ethermail.io) by connecting an Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect). This may grant an initial bonus of EMC points (e.g., 50–250 EMC, depending on the campaign).
- **Wallet Activity Requirement:** Must use an Ethereum wallet with at least one prior transaction on the Ethereum mainnet. New wallets created solely for the airdrop may be disqualified.
- **Provide a Secondary Email:** Link a backup email address to your EtherMail account to earn additional EMC points (e.g., 200 EMC).
- **Engage with Emails:** Read emails sent to the EtherMail inbox to earn EMC points (e.g., 1 EMC per email read, with a cap of 1,000 EMC per month).
- **Refer Friends:** Invite friends via a referral link. Each successful referral (friend signs up and completes basic tasks) can earn 250 EMC. Some campaigns may require a minimum number of referrals (e.g., 5) for higher reward tiers.
- **Complete KYC Verification:** Required for certain airdrop pools or to claim tokens to ensure distribution integrity.
- **Optional Tasks for Extra Points:** Connect the wallet to additional features (e.g., IMAP integration for +500 EMC), engage with EtherMail’s social media, or subscribe to partnered newsletters.
