- Boosted volume traded during farm boost and extension
- aeUSD balance
- First trade made on Aevo
- Active usage of Aevo

Users were penalized for:

- Abusing deep out-of-the-money (OTM) options
- Engaging in wash trading (opening and closing positions within short time frames)

Non-Aevo traders received farm boosts (not tokens) based on their trading activity on other derivative DEXs. These users can claim their farm boost and trade on Aevo to earn 2x-4x more $AEVO.

veRBN max lockers will receive a separate airdrop event in the coming weeks.
