### Wave 5: Long-Term Ecosystem Holders
- Rewards loyal addresses across multiple ecosystems.
- **Eligible Tokens:** Holders of Starknet (STRK), Mina Protocol (MINA), ZKSync (ZK), Polygon (POL), Scroll (SCR), Taiko (TAIKO), EigenLayer (EIGEN).
- **Holding Requirement:** Users must have held these tokens at their all-time low prices, with a minimum holding threshold of $50 USD worth of tokens at the all-time low price.
  - Example: If a token's all-time low was $0.10, the user needed at least 500 tokens in their wallet at that time.
- **Wallet Compatibility:** Eligible wallets must be on Ethereum, Mina, StarkNet, and Polygon. Tokens must not have been staked or used in liquidity pools.
- **Registration Deadline:** Eligible addresses must have registered their wallets by December 23, 2024 via [genesis.alignedfoundation.org](https://genesis.alignedfoundation.org).
- **Anti-Sybil Measures:** All-time low price snapshots (which occurred at different times for each token) were used to prevent manipulation. No scoring metrics favor airdrop farmingâ€”this strictly rewards long-term holders.
