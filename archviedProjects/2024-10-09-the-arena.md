## Additional Information

- **Total Supply**: 10 billion $ARENA tokens.
- **Governance Role**: $ARENA is used for governance (1 token = 1 vote).
- **Future Airdrops**: Additional airdrops like $ERROR may be introduced for active users.
- **Ongoing Token Distribution**: After the initial airdrop, $ARENA will continue to be distributed based on platform activity.
- **Governance Voting**: The first governance vote will determine whether The Arena moves to its own subnet or remains on Avalanche’s C-Chain.
- **Potential Migration**: If The Arena moves to its own subnet, $ARENA may gain additional utility as a native gas token.
- **Transferability**: Claimed tokens can be freely traded or used within the platform. However, only tokens earned through airdrop points or future programs count toward governance votes.
- **Security Warning**: Users should only interact with the official contract address to avoid scams.
