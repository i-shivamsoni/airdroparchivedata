## [Eligibility Criteria](https://docs.zknation.io/zk-token/zk-airdrop)

Eligibility for the zkSync airdrop was based on the following requirements:

### Usage-Based Airdrop
Every address that transacted on ZKsync Era or ZKsync Lite was checked against the eligibility criteria. Each address needed at least one point from the following activities:
- Interacting with at least 10 non-token smart contracts.
- Using paymasters for at least 5 transactions.
- Trading at least 10 distinct ERC-20 tokens on ZKsync DEXs.
- Providing any liquidity to tracked DeFi protocols.
- Holding at least 1 Libertas Omnibus NFT.
- Being active for 3+ months on ZKsync Lite.
- Donating to Gitcoin rounds on ZKsync Lite.

### Allocation
Allocation was determined by a **value-scaling formula**, which accounted for:
- The amount of crypto-assets bridged to ZKsync Era.
- How long assets remained in the wallet.
- Crypto-assets held in DeFi protocols were valued at 2x their nominal value.

### Multipliers
Certain activities increased token allocations:
- Holding specific ZKsync NFT collections.
- Holding $50+ of certain ZKsync native ERC-20 tokens.
- Using smart contract wallets created via ZKsync native account abstraction.
- Holding 50%+ of ARB/OP/ENS airdrops for 90+ days.
- Being among the first 1,000 addresses to interact with high-value Ethereum smart contracts.

### Sybil Detection
To prevent bot activity, a conservative heuristic framework was applied:
- **CEX Deposit Address Reuse:** EOAs sending funds to the same CEX deposit address were grouped.
- **Common Funding Patterns:** Addresses funded from the same sources in similar time frames were grouped.
- **Filtering Large Clusters:** Clusters of 20+ linked EOAs were removed from the airdrop.

### Contribution-Based Airdrop
The following groups received additional allocations:
- **ZKsync Native Projects:** 215,250,000 ZK allocated to projects building on ZKsync Era (DeFi, gaming, infrastructure, etc.).
- **Builders:** 86,895,375 ZK allocated to individual contributors, including GitHub Developers (25+ commits), Ethereum researchers (Protocol Guild), and GitHub discussion participants.
- **Security Researchers:** Participants in security audits via Code4rena, Cantina, or Codehawks.
- **Community Moderators:** Moderators and zkStars program members.
- **Event POAP Holders:** Individuals who attended ZKsync in-person events and collected specific POAPs.

### Onchain Communities Airdrop
A portion of the airdrop was allocated to experimental onchain communities:
- **$DEGEN Airdrop Recipients:** Season 1 $DEGEN airdrop recipients on Farcaster.
- **$BONSAI Airdrop Recipients:** Season 1 $BONSAI airdrop recipients on Lens.
- **Crypto The Game:** Participants in Season 1, Season 2, and the CTG team.
- **Pudgy Penguin & Milady Maker Holders:** Holders of these NFTs (allocated per address, not per NFT).
