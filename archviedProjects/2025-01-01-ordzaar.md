## Eligibility Criteria

Exact airdrop criteria were not explicitly detailed in a single official list across all sources, the following points are inferred from announcements, posts on X, and related web content.
Eligibility for the Ordzaar airdrop is determined by various factors across different phases:

### **ZAAR Token Airdrop:**
