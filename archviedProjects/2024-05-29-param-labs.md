## Eligibility Criteria

Participants typically need to:

- **Account Creation**: Create an account on the Param Gaming platform ([paramgaming.com](https://paramgaming.com)), involving signing up with an email address or connecting a social media account (e.g., Twitter/X).

- **Social Media Engagement**: Link a Twitter/X account to their Param Gaming profile. Completing social tasks, such as following Param Labs’ official accounts, liking, retweeting, or posting with specific hashtags (e.g., $PARAM or @ParamLaboratory), often earns participants PARAM Points.

- **PARAM Points Accumulation**: Earn PARAM Points, an off-chain virtual currency within the Param ecosystem, through activities like:

  - Signing up (e.g., 50 points as a welcome bonus).
  - Completing daily or one-time social media tasks.
  - Referring friends (e.g., bonus points per referral).

- **Wallet Requirements**: Have a compatible cryptocurrency wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to claim tokens. The $PARAM token operates on Ethereum or Arbitrum networks. Wallets must have some activity history (e.g., token holding, staking, or transactions) to be eligible, as new or empty wallets are often excluded.

- **Eligibility for Specific Groups**:

  - **Kira Genesis NFT Holders**: Holders of Param Labs’ Kira Genesis NFT collection may receive additional airdrop allocations based on the number of NFTs owned.
  - **Point Participants**: Those who accumulated PARAM Points during the campaign can claim tokens proportional to their point totals.

- **Claim Process**: Connect their wallet to an official claim portal (e.g., [Param Point Participants Claim](https://claim.paramgaming.com/) or Kira Genesis Holders Claim page) to verify eligibility and claim tokens.

- **Deadlines and Conditions**: Previous claim windows have had deadlines (e.g., June 5, 2024, for an earlier phase). Unclaimed tokens are typically returned to the ecosystem rewards pool. Participants must comply with applicable laws and be at least 18 years old.
