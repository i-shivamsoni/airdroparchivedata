Users can earn Symmio Points, which will later be converted into $SYMM tokens, by participating in the following activities:

- **Platform Usage**: Actively trade on Symmioâ€™s supported frontends.
- **Ecosystem Token Holding**: Holding specific Symmio ecosystem tokens (e.g., INTX, PEAR, BASED, CORE/LODE).
- **Community Engagement**: Active participation in discussions, contributions, and content creation.

Points will be distributed without revealing exact calculation methods to prevent exploitation.
