## Eligibility Criteria

To participate in the Worldcoin Airdrop Program, users must:

- **Obtain a World ID verified account**: Complete at least one form of verificationâ€”either Orb Verification or Passport Verification.
  - **Orb Verification**: Provides a high level of certainty that a user is a unique human and offers the highest amount of WLD tokens that a user can claim.
  - **Passport Verification**: Offers more convenience by verifying a passport as a credential in the World App but provides a lower level of certainty about the user's uniqueness, resulting in fewer tokens than Orb Verification. This method is subject to eligibility and availability.
- **Enroll in the airdrop**: Once verified, eligible users can sign up for the airdrop within the World App to see the amount of WLD they are eligible to claim.
- **Be non-U.S. persons and not located in the U.S.**: The Airdrop Program is only available to World ID users who meet the eligibility requirements set forth in Worldcoin's Terms and are not U.S. persons or located in the United States.

Completing both Orb and Passport Verifications demonstrates the highest level of assurance that a user is a unique human, making them eligible to claim the largest token amount available when combined.

## Additional Information

- **Claiming Process**:

  - **First Claim**: Users can claim their first WLD tokens 24 hours after verification and enrollment.
  - **Monthly Claims**: Each month, on the same date as the initial verification, users can claim a new portion of WLD. Users have a full month to claim their tokens before the next allotment becomes available.
  - **Second Verification**: Completing both verification methods unlocks additional tokens, as it provides the highest confidence that the user is a unique human.

- **Token Reservation**:

  - As of August 1, 2024, users can no longer reserve new WLD tokens. However, any previously reserved tokens will remain claimable until July 31, 2025.

- **Disclaimer**:
  - The Airdrop Program is only available to World ID users who meet the eligibility requirements set forth in Worldcoin's Terms and are not U.S. persons or located in the United States.
