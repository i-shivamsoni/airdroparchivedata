## Eligibility Criteria

The Penumbra UM airdrop targeted two primary groups:

- **Active Cosmos DeFi Users**: Wallet addresses actively engaged in Cosmos-based decentralized finance activities.
- **Developers**: Contributors to repositories that supported Penumbra's creation or were critical to the broader crypto ecosystem.

Each group was allocated 8% of the total UM token supply. Additionally, claimants who chose to stake their tokens with a validator aiming to be part of the genesis set received an in-category multiplier, enhancing their token allocation.

## Additional Information

- **Token Lockups**: All investor and team tokens are locked to ensure commitment and stability within the ecosystem.
- **Institute for Applied Numogrammatics (IAN)**: A Cayman foundation allocated 20% of the genesis supply, dedicated to supporting the Penumbra protocol through grants and ecosystem growth initiatives.
- **Community Pool**: Holds 25% of the token supply, with allocations earmarked for future community distribution and use, as approved by governance. At genesis, these tokens are frozen via a chain parameter as a conservative risk mitigation measure.
