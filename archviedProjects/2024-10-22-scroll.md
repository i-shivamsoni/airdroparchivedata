## [Eligibility Criteria](https://scroll.io/blog/introducing-scrolls-first-airdrop-a-celebration-of-the-global-community)

Scroll’s first airdrop was announced on October 19, 2024, with a snapshot taken at 00:00 UTC that day. It distributed 7% of the total SCR token supply (1 billion tokens) to reward early contributors and community members. Here’s how eligibility worked:

### Scroll Sessions Program (Marks System):

- Users earned "Marks" by participating in on-chain activities within the Scroll ecosystem during Session 1.
- A minimum of 200 Marks was required to qualify for the airdrop.
- Out of 5.5% of the supply (55 million SCR), 4% was allocated to users with 200+ Marks, rewarding active participation.
- Over 570,000 wallets qualified, with the majority being active contributors who accumulated Marks.

### On-Chain Activity:

- Bridging assets (e.g., ETH or wstETH) from Ethereum mainnet to Scroll Layer-2 using the official Scroll bridge or recommended bridges like Rhino.fi.
- Interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) on Scroll, such as providing liquidity on DeFi platforms (e.g., Ambient, Aave), swapping tokens, or minting NFTs like the Scroller NFT.
- Holding assets on Scroll over time increased Marks, with boosts for specific actions like using smart contract wallets.

### Community and Ecosystem Contributions:

- Beyond regular users, rewards went to developers building on Scroll, researchers, event organizers, and global community members who supported Ethereum’s ecosystem.
- Specific allocations weren’t tied to Marks but to contributions like TVL (total value locked) in projects or hackathon participation.

### Additional Airdrop Allocations:

- **Flat Boost:** 1% of total supply equally distributed among all eligible on-chain participants.
- **Onchain Bonus (0.5% of total supply) awarded to those who:**
  - Hold a top-level ENS name (e.g., scroll.eth).
  - Donate more than $0.01 to any grant on Gitcoin.
  - Donate to any campaign on Juicebox.
  - Use a smart contract wallet on Scroll.

### Ecosystem Projects

- Projects building on Scroll, assessed by TVL and native integration.

### Industry Contributors

- Open-source contributors, ZK researchers, technical contributors, and public goods organizations.

### Global Community

- Community organizers, hackathon winners, Devcon communities, Ethereum translators, and Discord moderators.

- SCR will be used for governance via Scroll DAO, incentivizing provers, and ensuring decentralization in sequencing.
- The claim period lasts 90 days from October 22, 2024.
- Future rewards programs (e.g., Scroll Open) will continue to recognize key contributors.
