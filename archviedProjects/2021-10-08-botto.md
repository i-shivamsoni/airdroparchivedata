## [Eligibility Criteria](https://docs.botto.com/details/token-distribution/airdrop)

To qualify for the airdrop, users had to interact with at least one qualifying NFT project, either by holding or minting an NFT. The airdrop was divided into four tiers:

- **Tier 1**: 1 interaction with a qualifying project → **646 BOTTO**
- **Tier 2**: 2 interactions with qualifying projects → **1,893 BOTTO**
- **Tier 3**: 5 interactions with qualifying projects (also included early contributors) → **4,576 BOTTO**
- **Tier 4**: Reserved for initial team members for redistribution → **26,666 BOTTO**

Interactions were recorded using the Etherscan API and counted as follows:

- Minting or holding an NFT = **1 interaction**
- Multiple transactions within the same project still counted as **1 interaction**
- Selling an NFT after minting before the snapshot still counted as **1 interaction**
