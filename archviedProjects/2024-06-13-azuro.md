## Eligibility Criteria

The eligibility for Snapshot #1 includes:

- **Pool 1**: 19,000,000 tokens distributed linearly based on Azuro Score.
- **Pool 2**: 31,262,000 tokens distributed linearly to Azuro Score, connected to using Azuro-powered apps (betting).
- **Pool 3**: 3,000,000 tokens distributed linearly based on Azuro Score received in Phase 1.
- **Pool 4**: 3,000,000 tokens distributed to the top 3,000 addresses (1,000 each) ranked by consistency. Consistency is measured by the number of weeks an address has used any Azuro-powered app. This resulted in 3,484 addresses, 541 of which had exactly 6 weeks of activity. To determine the final 57 addresses that make it into the top 3,000, they were ranked by points received for LPing.
- **Pool 5**: 738,000 tokens distributed to 738 addresses (1,000 each) that held testnet NFTs.

In total, 50% of the tokens are unlocked at the Token Generation Event (TGE), and 50% are vested linearly over 183 days, block by block. All tokens up to 1,000 are fully unlocked, meaning 43,459 addresses receive more than 50% unlocked tokens. To promote a better balance, the 2,207 top receiving addresses receive 45% unlocked and 55% vested.
