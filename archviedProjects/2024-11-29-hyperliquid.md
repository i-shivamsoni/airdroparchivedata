## [Eligibility Criteria](https://x.com/HyperliquidX/status/1862402701705060486)

Eligibility for the Hyperliquid airdrop was based on the following requirements:

### Points Accumulation
- Users needed to earn points by March 26, 2024.
- Points were the key determinant for airdrop eligibility, with volume traded being the primary factor in earning points.

### Acceptance of Terms
- Users were required to accept the new Terms & Conditions on the website before the token launch in April 2024.
- Those who failed to accept the Terms & Conditions in time missed out on the airdrop.
- Users who accepted the T&Cs late (during the fourth reopening) received a 50% slashed airdrop due to the inability to run sybil detection on the final batch of participants.

### Distribution
- The airdrop was distributed directly to users' Hyperliquid accounts.
- There was speculation about a tiered distribution based on user league rankings.
