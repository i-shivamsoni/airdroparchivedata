- **Blast Gold Holders:** Users who contributed to the success of decentralized applications (Dapps) on the Blast ecosystem earned Blast Gold. These users are also eligible for 7% of the total BLAST supply.

- **Top 0.1% Users:** Approximately 1,000 wallets in the top 0.1% will have a portion of their airdrop vested linearly over six months. Vesting is subject to reaching a monthly Points threshold based on Phase 1 activity, with further details available on June 26, 2024.

- **Blur Foundation:** The Blur Foundation will receive 3% of the total BLAST supply to distribute to the Blur community for both retroactive and future airdrops.

## Additional Information

- **Phase 2 Airdrop:** Initially scheduled to end in June 2025 with an allocation of 10 billion BLAST, Phase 2 has been adjusted to conclude in January 2025 with a prorated allocation of 5 billion BLAST. This transition aligns with the release of Blast Mobile, allowing users and Dapps to earn liquid BLAST rewards directly, rather than through points and Gold.

- **Vesting Details:** The top 0.1% of users (~1,000 wallets) will have a portion of their airdrop vested linearly over six months. Vesting is contingent upon reaching a monthly Points threshold based on Phase 1 activity, with further details provided on June 26, 2024.

- **Token Allocation:** The total BLAST supply is 100 billion tokens, distributed as follows:
  - Community: 50% (50 billion BLAST)
  - Core Contributors: 25.5% (25.48 billion BLAST)
  - Investors: 16.5% (16.52 billion BLAST)
  - Blast Foundation: 8% (8 billion BLAST)
