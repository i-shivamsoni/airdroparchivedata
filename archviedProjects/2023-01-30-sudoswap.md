## Additional Information

- **Governance Participation**: SUDO tokens are used to govern the sudoAMM protocol via an on-chain OpenZeppelin Governor module. Holders can vote on protocol parameters such as fee structures, addition of new routers, pool whitelisting, and bonding curves.
- **Proposal Creation**: Addresses with a minimum of 300,000 SUDO delegated can create on-chain proposals. A proposal requires a voting delay of 2 days, a voting period of 3 days, and at least 2.4 million SUDO votes in favor to be executed.
- **Token Transferability**: Initially, SUDO tokens are non-transferable. Transferability can be enabled through a standard governance vote.
