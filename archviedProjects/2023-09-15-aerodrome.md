## Additional Information

- **Ecosystem Pairs and Public Goods Funding**: 25% of Aerodrome’s initial votepower is reserved for Ecosystem Goods. This allocation aims to power liquidity on assets crucial to the ecosystem's success. Fees earned from these pairs will be used for public goods funding (PGF) and public goods votepower, positioning $AERO as the engine of the ecosystem.
- **Team Allocation**: Aerodrome contributors will receive veAERO, vested over 2–4 years, aligning their incentives with the long-term health of the protocol and overall ecosystem.
- **Protocol Grants**: Top protocols engaging positively with the Aerodrome ecosystem may qualify for veAERO voting power grants for the duration of their programs, adding long-term value and attracting new projects.
- **AERO Emissions**: Emissions will start at 10 million AERO per epoch (week) and follow three phases:
  - **Take-off**: The first 14 epochs will see emissions increase by 3% per epoch, peaking slightly above 15 million AERO.
  - **Cruise**: After epoch 14, emissions will decay at 1% per epoch, ensuring a decrease in supply inflation as the protocol matures.
  - **Aero FED**: When emissions drop below 9 million per epoch (around epoch 67), veAERO voters will control Aerodrome’s monetary policy through the Aero Fed system, with options to adjust emissions rates.
